## Pest Agent Browser Plugin

`vendor/bin/pest --agent-browser="<code>"` runs a one-off Pest assertion without creating a test file — the fastest way to verify that a change actually works (a route response, a model relationship, a rendered page, a form submission, mail firing, a screenshot, JavaScript errors, and so on).

### ALWAYS load the skill first

Whenever the user asks you to check, verify, confirm, or "make sure" something **works** — and it can be exercised on a route, page, form, model, job, mail, notification, or screenshot — you **MUST** load the **`pest-plugin-agent-browser` skill before doing anything else**. Do not reach for a shell command, a throwaway test file, or manual reasoning first. This includes prompts like "verify the login form works", "did my change break X", "screenshot the homepage", "check this route returns 200", "make sure the mail fires", "is the form working", or any behavioral check after a Blade, Livewire, CSS, or JS change. Load the skill, then follow it exactly.

### NEVER fight shell escaping — use SINGLE outer quotes

Inline the snippet, but wrap it in **single** quotes, not double. Single quotes tell the shell to interpret nothing, so `$variables`, `\App\Models\User`, backticks, and `!` all pass through to PHP literally — **there is nothing to escape.** Use double quotes for PHP string literals inside:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest --agent-browser='$user = \App\Models\User::factory()->create(); visit("/login")->type("email", $user->email)->press("Log in")->assertPathIs("/dashboard");'
```

Double outer quotes are the trap the shell springs on you — `--agent-browser="…$user…"` makes the shell interpolate `$user` to nothing. Never do that, and never hand-escape `\$`.

The one thing single quotes can't contain is a literal single quote (an apostrophe in the PHP). Only then, fall back to a file: **Write** the snippet to a `.php` file (plain body statements — no `<?php`, no `use`, fully qualified class names) and run `vendor/bin/pest --agent-browser="$(cat /path/to/snippet.php)"`. `"$(cat …)"` passes the contents verbatim without re-parsing. The plugin resolves the test suite's `uses`/namespace itself, so the file's location does not matter (a scratch/temp path is fine — it need not live under `tests/`).

For full usage — backend examples, browser testing, screenshots, responsive checks, combining frontend and backend assertions, RefreshDatabase guidance, and pitfalls — load the **`pest-plugin-agent-browser` skill**.
